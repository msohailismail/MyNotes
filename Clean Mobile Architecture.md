Designing an application to be testable is crucial for its longevity.
#### Products vs. Projects
A **project** is temporary in that it has a defined beginning and end in time and thus defined scope and resources.  
A **product** is an object or system made available for consumer use; it is anything that can be offered to a market to satisfy a desire or need.
  
Software development nowadays is mainly about building products. It involves many unknowns that make it hard for us to have the certainties projects require upfront.   When we start working on a new app, we know the least about the software that we are building.  
Software evolves constantly. Think of the apps you use in your daily life. We are continually receiving updates, whether for bug-fixing, adding new features, or improving the UX. Take as an example your favorite social media or telecom app; how much has it changed over the past two years? Does this fit into the definition of a project? Do these applications have “a defined beginning and end in time”? And how about scope and resources? Do they seem to have been fixed upfront?  
Any piece of software with a fixed scope and time will become obsolete. Regardless of how innovative the idea is, evolving competition will eventually increase, eating up the market.  

To define how elaborate an app’s architectural design should be, we must take into account its context, which includes:  
- The people involved.
- The technical complexity. 
- The intended lifespan.
